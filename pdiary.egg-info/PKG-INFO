## Installation

To install, simply use `pip`:

    pip install pdiary

## Usage
It is recommended to run pdiary in a terminal that's support 256 colors, resize and UTF-8.

To run pdiary open a terminal and type:

    pdiary

The interaction of the software is made through the keyboard arrow keys and also the TAB key. Enter key is used for select and confirm.
If your terminal supports mouse interaction you also can control the widgets with the mouse.

## Troubleshooting

Pdiary was designed to display symbols/glyphs as icons instead of emojis.
*Maybe you like to use Pdiary with emojis, personally i think it's very ugly but the choice is yours.*

You may encounter missing icons/symbols, this occurs because you don't have the appropriate font to display them.
You can solve this by installing this font.

- Debian/Ubuntu:
`apt install fonts-symbola`

- Arch Linux:
You can find the package "`ttf-symbola`" in AUR.

To display the icons corretly you need to remove the font with the emojis.
In Ubunbu/Debian the package is called "`fonts-noto-color-emoji`"
On arch it is "`noto-fonts-emoji`"
In another distributions the name must be similar.

## Known Issues

- In some old terminals without support to new technologies some errors may occur, like the non exhibition of some icons and some characters, it can also have some trouble with colors.
- Pdiary is responsive, positioning is done according to terminal sizes, but sometimes it might break. If so, try in a terminal with a different size.
